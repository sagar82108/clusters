    "Q1. **Homogeneity and Completeness**:\n",
    "   - **Homogeneity**: Measures if each cluster contains only data points from a single class or category.\n",
    "   - **Completeness**: Measures if all data points of a single class are assigned to the same cluster.\n",
    "   - They are calculated using conditional entropy and entropy formulas, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. **V-measure**:\n",
    "   - Combines homogeneity and completeness into a single metric.\n",
    "   - V-measure is the harmonic mean of homogeneity and completeness.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. **Silhouette Coefficient**:\n",
    "   - Measures the quality of a clustering result.\n",
    "   - Ranges from -1 (incorrect clustering) to 1 (high-quality clustering) with 0 indicating overlapping clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. **Davies-Bouldin Index**:\n",
    "   - Evaluates clustering quality based on the average similarity between each cluster and its most similar cluster.\n",
    "   - Lower values indicate better clustering quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. **High Homogeneity, Low Completeness**:\n",
    "   - Yes, it's possible. Example: Clustering news articles by topics. One cluster contains only politics \n",
    "    articles (high homogeneity), but politics articles are also found in other clusters (low completeness).\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6. **V-measure for Optimal Clusters**:\n",
    "   - V-measure can help find the optimal number of clusters by comparing it across different K values in\n",
    "     various clustering solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q7. **Silhouette Coefficient Advantages/Disadvantages**:\n",
    "   - Advantages: Easy to understand, works with any clustering algorithm.\n",
    "   - Disadvantages: Sensitive to shape and density, may not perform well with irregular clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q8. **Davies-Bouldin Index Limitations**:\n",
    "   - Assumes clusters are convex and equally sized.\n",
    "   - Limitation can be overcome by using other metrics for more complex clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q9. **Homogeneity, Completeness, and V-measure Relationship**:\n",
    "   - V-measure combines homogeneity and completeness.\n",
    "   - They can have different values for the same clustering result.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q10. **Using Silhouette Coefficient for Comparing Algorithms**:\n",
    "   - Apply Silhouette Coefficient to different algorithms on the same dataset.\n",
    "   - Watch out for varying data distributions and preprocessing effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q11. **Davies-Bouldin Index for Separation and Compactness**:\n",
    "   - Measures how well-separated clusters are (low similarity between clusters) and \n",
    "     how compact clusters are (low intra-cluster variance).\n",
    "   - Assumes clusters are convex and equally sized.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q12. **Silhouette Coefficient for Hierarchical Clustering**:\n",
    "   - Yes, it can be used.\n",
    "   - Calculate the Silhouette Coefficient for each data point using the hierarchy's final clustering."
